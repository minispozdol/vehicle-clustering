# vehicle-clustering

## Instructions for setup
In order to run this project, you will need an installation of Python, Jupyter and all associate libraries:
* Seaborn
* Numpy
* Pandas

A web browers should also be installed if the user vishes to see any of the data visualizations and graphs. 
Once Jupyter notebook in running and all libraries are successfully loaded onto the natebook, then there is an order of which file to run first before the others. For my workspace, the file "preprocessing.py" should run first before runnign the "final_evaluation.py" or the evaluationipynb. This will allow the raw csv file to be process into input for the algorithm.
